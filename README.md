# Title:
Cat and Dog Classification using Convolutional Neural Network's

## About Dataset:
This dataset consists of 25,000 labeled images intended for training. To optimize the process,  20,000 images will be selected for training, 5000 for validation.
Additionally, separate unlabeled images are used to test the model performence.

## Results

I trained the model both with and without image augmentation, and the results were similar, with a slight improvement when using image generation. The accuracy reached 80%, which is below the desired level, likely due to the limited number of training images.

As shown in the image, not all predictions were accurate.

## Conclusion and Future Improvements:
To achieve a higher accuracy score, future efforts should focus on training with a larger dataset and refining the model architecture. These steps could significantly enhance the model's performance.
